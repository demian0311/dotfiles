# anchor — the front door for its dev servers

Anchor serves its dev servers over Tailscale, at real HTTPS, to any device on
the tailnet. `https://anchor.tailb10eb2.ts.net/` lists them and links to the
ones that are running.

Nothing here is public. Tailscale answers only devices on your own tailnet, and
no port is open to the internet.

## Contents

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `hub.mjs` | the front door, plus one Host-rewriting proxy per service |
| `systemd/` | user units for the hub, the ecosystem docs and the marketing site |
| `install.sh` | run it on anchor from a checkout of this repo |

## The port arithmetic

Three numbers per service, and the gaps are load-bearing:

- **local** — what the dev server binds, from the workspace port table
- **public** = local + 10000 — what `tailscale serve` terminates TLS on
- **proxy** = local + 20000 — the hub's Host-rewriting listener in between

🔴 **Public must never equal local.** Serving on the port the dev server uses
puts a tailscaled listener on that number; Vite's own availability check reads
it as busy and the dev server slides to the next port, after which the proxy
points at nothing.

🔴 **The rewriting proxy is not optional.** Vite refuses any request whose
`Host` header it does not recognise. The obvious fix is an `allowedHosts` line
in each repo's config, and it does not survive contact with git — the edit sits
in a tracked file, so stashing to take a pull removes it, the dev server
restarts without it, and the site starts answering 403 with nothing in the log
saying why. Rewriting the header in one place keeps every checkout clean.

## Adding a service

One row in `SERVICES` in `hub.mjs`, restart the hub, then on anchor:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --https=<local+10000> http://localhost:<local+20000>
```

Start the dev server with its bind address pinned — `--host 127.0.0.1`. Left to
itself Astro binds IPv6 loopback only on that box, and a restart can move it.

## Notes

- The full runbook, with what breaks and why, is on the ecosystem docs site at
  `infrastructure/anchor-over-tailscale`.
- `loginctl enable-linger` is what lets the units run with nobody logged in.
- The `PATH` line in each unit is not decoration: a systemd user unit gets no
  login shell, so none of mise's tools are on its path — the same trap that
  makes `ssh anchor '<cmd>'` fail to find node.
